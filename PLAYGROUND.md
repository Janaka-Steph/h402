## Playground

To detail and showcase our idea of the 402 protocol, we've built a public playground available at [play.bitgpt.xyz](https://play.bitgpt.xyz). It demonstrates how the 402 payment flow works in comparison to traditional human checkouts.

In a typical crypto checkout, users go through multiple steps: connecting a wallet, signing a transaction, and broadcasting it.

While this flow mirrors traditional credit card payments, itâ€™s unsuitable for machine-based transactions. Agents require a native protocol built for programmatic interaction, not one retrofitted from human-centric experiences.

Our playground illustrates the 402 flow from the agent's perspective: initiating payments on the user's behalf, negotiating terms, and requesting final confirmation from the user.

This interface is demo-only; in real-world use, these interactions occur purely via HTTP between the agent (acting for the user) and the server (BitGPT or any service provider).

The 402 flow can vary based on the payment scheme and user-agent configuration. For instance, in the absence of a default payment method, the user must manually select one.

- `exact`: Simple flow with known amount.
- `upto`, `prepaid`, `streamed`, `subscription`, `postpaid`: More dynamic, require negotiation or ongoing interaction.

The playground is still under active development. While it currently mocks the protocol and checkout interface, more examples and features will be added soon, both here and in the soon-to-be-open-sourced repository.
